        <h3>Everything you need to know about the various factions of the tabletop miniatures game.</h3>

        <h2>The Setting</h2>
        <p>It is the 41st millenium. The whole galaxy is torn in conflict. The Imperium of Man, a shattered and fascist planet-spanning empire, stands alone against the mutant, the heretic, and the alien. New threats arise, and old dangers return. Humanity's Space Marines, genetically enhanced super-soldiers, fight against the forces of Chaos and the ever-growing tide of alien invasion. There is no peace. There is only war. </p>
